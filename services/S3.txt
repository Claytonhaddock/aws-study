- Simple Storage Service -


 - Object-based storage (designed to hold asset files). Not suitable for installing OS
 - Data is spread across multiple devices and facilities
 - unlimited storage
 - Files are stored in buckets
 - Buckets must have unique names globally
 - Transfer acceleration uses edge caches
 - files can be from 0bytes to 5TB
 - Objects consist of:
 	- Key (name)
 	- Value (the data being stored)
 	- Version ID
 	- Metadata
 	- subresources

How does data consistency work for S3?
	- Read after consistency for PUTS of new object
		- If you write a new file and then read, you will be able to read immediately
	- eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES
		- If you update an existing file or delete a file and read it immediately, you may get the older version becaue the new file hasn't propogated.

Storage classes: 6x
	- S3 standard
	- S3 - IA (infrequently accessed) for data that isn't often accessed
	- S3 One Zone - IA - cheapest option for infrequent data not reuquiring multiple availability zones
	- S3 - Intelligent Tiering - optimizes costs by automatically moving data to the cost-effective access tier with peformance impact or operation overhead
	- S3 Glacier - secure, durable, cheap storage. Configurable retrieval time
	- S3 glacier deep archive - retrieval time of 12 hours, but very cheap

S3 Charges:
- Storage
- requests
- Storage management pricing
- Data transfer pricing
- Tranfer acceleration
	- enable fast easy and secure transfer of files over long distances between your end users and S3 bucket. Caching files on edge locations.
- cross region replication pricing
	- Allows for two buckets which replicates files to one another for preservation
