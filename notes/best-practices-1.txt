Architecting for the cloud - Best practices:
- Read the white papers they mention!
1. Traditional computing vs cloud computing
 - IT assets as provisioned resources (cloudformation, terraform)
 - Global, available, and scaleable capacity
 - Higher level managed services (machine learning)
 - Built-in security. Safer to host infra on AWS than hosting yourself or on prem.
 - Architecting for cost. Can design cloud infra to be as cost efficient as possible.
 - Operations on AWS. Most companies do 'lift and shift' to bring their services into AWS

 Scalability:
 	- scale up - increasing amount of ram or cpu in a VM
 	- scale out - increasing number of VMs
 		- Stateless Applications: (lambda) alexa
 		- Distribute load to multiple nodes
 		- stateless components: ex. sign into website using cookie by storing in users browser
 		- stateful components: ex. store user data in a DB.
 		- implement session affinity: sticky session means you put cookie in user browser, every time they visit a site an App Load Balancer will detect the cookie and assign the user back to the same EC2 instance.
 		- Distributed Processing - elastic map reduce
 		- Implement Distributed Processing - Handle large, complex amounts of data by using many EC2 instances, instead of using one in order to process the data faster.

Instantiation Compute Resources:
	- Bootstrapping
	- Golden Images: take an image of an EC2 instance as a template to make new ones
	- Containers
	- Hybrid

Infrastructure as code:
	- Cloudformation

Automation:
	- serverless management and deployment: lambda and stateless stuff. COde pipeline and deployment
	- Infrastructure management and deployment:
		- AWS elastic beanstalk
		- Amazon EC2 auto recovery
		- AWS Systems manager
		- Auto Scaling

	- Alarms and Events:
		- cloudwatch alarms
		- cloudwatch events
		- Lambda scheduled events
		- WAF security

Loose coupling:
	- Well defined interfaces
		- Amazon API Gateway
	- Service Discovery
		- Implement Service Discovery

Distributed systems best pracitces:
	- Graceful failure in practice

Services not servers
	- Managed services
		- lambda
		- S3
	-Serverless architecture
