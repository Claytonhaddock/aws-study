Global Infrastructure:
	 - 19 regions - geographical area (us-east-1) that consists of 2+ availability zones
	 - 57 availablility zones - 1+ Datacenters
	 - Edge location - endpoints(?) for AWS which are used for caching content, usually for cloudfront. Can use lambdas lambda@edge

Choosing the right AWS region:
	- Data sovereignty laws - some countries may have more stringent laws
	- Latency to end users
	- AWS services availability - some regions may have different services available
